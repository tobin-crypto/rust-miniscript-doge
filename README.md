# Miniscript for Dogecoin

This repository was forked from
[rust-miniscript](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-miniscript) in an effort
to work with Dogecoin in Rust.

The dogecoin patchset is extremely small, currently all we do is:

- Add this section to the README.
- Rename the package.
- Depend upon [rust-dogecoin](https://github.com/tobin-crypto/rust-dogecoin)
  (dogecoin fork of
  [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin)).

## ----- Original rust-miniscript README ------

![Build](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-miniscript/workflows/Continuous%20integration/badge.svg)

**Minimum Supported Rust Version:** 1.29.0

*This crate uses "2015" edition and won't be ported over "2018" edition
in the near future as this will change the MSRV to 1.31.*

# Miniscript

Library for handling [Miniscript](http://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/),
which is a subset of Bitcoin Script designed to support simple and general
tooling. Miniscripts represent threshold circuits of spending conditions,
and can therefore be easily visualized or serialized as human-readable
strings.

## High-Level Features

This library supports

* [Output descriptors](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md)
including embedded Miniscripts
* Parsing and serializing descriptors to a human-readable string format
* Compilation of abstract spending policies to Miniscript (enabled by the
`compiler` flag)
* Semantic analysis of Miniscripts and spending policies, with user-defined
public key types
* Encoding and decoding Miniscript as Bitcoin Script, given key types that
are convertible to `dogecoin::PublicKey`
* Determining satisfiability, and optimal witnesses, for a given descriptor;
completing an unsigned `dogecoin::TxIn` with appropriate data
* Determining the specific keys, hash preimages and timelocks used to spend
coins in a given Bitcoin transaction

More information can be found in [the documentation](https://docs.rs/miniscript)
or in [the `examples/` directory](https://github.com/apoelstra/rust-miniscript/tree/master/examples)


## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
This library should always compile with any combination of features on **Rust 1.29**.

Because some dependencies have broken the build in minor/patch releases, to
compile with 1.29.0 you will need to run the following version-pinning command:
```
cargo update -p cc --precise "1.0.41" --verbose
```

In order to use the `use-serde` feature or to build the unit tests with 1.29.0,
the following version-pinning commands are also needed:
```
cargo update --package "serde" --precise "1.0.98"
cargo update --package "serde_derive" --precise "1.0.98"
```
